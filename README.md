# Full-Adder-using-Half-Adder
A full adder is a digital circuit that can be made from two half adders, and is used to add three single-digit binary numbers.
To obtain a full adder from a half adder we take the first two inputs and add them and use the sum and carry outputs and the third input to get the final sum and carry output of the full adder.

Half adder-
A standard circuit that can add two dual numbers to produce a sum and a carry.

Full adder-
A circuit that can add three single-digit binary numbers to produce a sum and a carry. It's made from two half adders and an OR gate. The OR gate generates a carry from the addition, and the second half adder produces the sum.
